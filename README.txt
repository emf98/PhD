Welcome!
This Github Repo contains some of my recent coding files for my PhD-related manuscripts from my time thus far at UAlbany. 
A lot of the actual data is not in here, but the code is! 

Please email me with any questions.

~ `Ellipse_Paper` is code from our 2025 Stratospheric Polar Vortex diagnostics work.
~ AI_Paper1 is my recent start at using CNNs for forecasting temperature anomalies based on the stratospheric polar vortex. ANN code from earlier this year (2024) is in that folder as well.
