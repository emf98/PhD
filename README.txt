Welcome!
This Github Repo is a reupload of a previous version to fix a push error and contains some of my recent coding files for my PhD-related manuscripts from my time thus far at UAlbany. 
A lot of the actual data is not in here, but the code is! If you would like to see the datasets I have used, please contact me.

The folders are separated based on the manuscripts. 

~ `Ellipse_Paper` is code from our 2024 Stratospheric Polar Vortex diagnostics work. This is looking to be sent to the Journal of Climate in January 2025.
~ AI_Paper1 is my recent start at using ANNs for forecasting temperature anomalies based on features from the stratosphere. This paper is also being prepared for submission, projected for May of 2025. 

Please email me with any questions. I generally respond within 1-2 business days.
