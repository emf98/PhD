Welcome!
This Github Repo contains some of my recent coding files for my PhD-related manuscripts from my time thus far at UAlbany. 
A lot of the actual data is not in here, but the code is! 

Please email me with any questions.

~ `Ellipse_Paper` is code from our 2025 Stratospheric Polar Vortex diagnostics work.
~ AI_Paper1 is my recent start at using ANNs for forecasting temperature anomalies based on features from the stratosphere.
