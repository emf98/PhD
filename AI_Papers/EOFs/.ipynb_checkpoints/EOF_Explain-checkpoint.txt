"Forecast of Opportunity, EOFs"
File created on May 7th, 2025. 

I wrote out by hand my exact process here, but this will be an extension of those words by providing context to the digital files I have stored. 

The first thing that needs to be done here is to save the correct data files, obviously. I have brought over the processing files. 
I am running that to save vertical U wind, V and T for EHF, and GPH. 
`ReformatERA5data`
One quick note for U wind, I did end up saving between 90 and 20 latitude to make it a zonal-mean cross section. 

GPH will be reduced to a meridional mean and then daily anomalies. 

EHF is effectively meridional mean meridional eddy heat flux?

I need to ignore the last dimension of these to make them all 62 years. 

Need to calculate daily anomalies.

May 8th. 
I created the file to do calculations for anomalies. `RemoveSeasonal` is the file.
I believe for the EOF analysis, I do not need to do any additional WEIGHTING because all three features are vertical cross sections and already were multiplied by weights in calculating meridional/zonal means.

I then went to save the appropriate temperature data in `TempClassing.`
There are files in temp_data for two classes of temp anomalies and medians for all three regions. 
Additionally, there are three classes of temp anomalies. 

All temp files and the three vertical anomaly files were uploaded to the H100 environment.

I had to take a break to write for the SPVMD manuscript, but I will be returning to this soon. Updating my Git now to reflect the changes to this work.
