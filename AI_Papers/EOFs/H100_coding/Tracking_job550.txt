Hiiiiiii....

In this file I am just going to make a record of what I am doing within this job. 
I have it set to run for 744 hours or 31 days, and I initialized it on April 7th, 2025. 

I would like to see if I am able to call files from my directory because if so ... that would be awesome.

Scratch that, actually lol
I had to set this up so that the ssh window would stay open via a "ServerAlive" message
But I am currently working on building a RF model for SFS based on the three features. 
100 PCs for PV
70 for EHF and 25 for GPH

So yesterday I had to restart/make a second H100 job to implement the "KeepAlive" statement for the job. 
Which means I currently have two environments working on the same thing. 
In the 581 env, I ran the code to select 7 features ... Which took just over 24 hours. I just had to restart the code here in 550 to select 11 features .... it is 8:59PM. We will see when this finishes and what the outcome is. 

Currently, looking at the results from the 7 features, the model seems to like EOFs ~13/14 from the GPH. Not sure what these show. This is also slightly problematic in that I am running this at 10 days lag. 
I may re-run this at 14. 

I did this for 7 features. I will now do it for 11.

I am going to be making .py files to run this code in the background because ... lol.
It keeps dying when the kernel closes out. 581 died at, like, hour 48 because my hard drive did that thing where it likes to disconnect. 

In terminal enter:
nohup python -u 10Day_EOF.py >& output_10Day.txt & disown

nohup python -u 14Day_EOF.py >& output_14Day.txt & disown

ps -wx (check is job is running)

I am actually saving FOURTEEN features here because I want the security of extra information ... the least important of those can be removed. 

Meanwhile in the other file where I have saved the 7 selected features I am going to start working on a ANN/LSTM model of some form. lol.

Good news is that these codes are still running. 
Unfortunately, I have a compatibility issue with the version of tensorflow installed on this environment, and I can't run my tuner in dgx550 on the completed feature selection of 7 features for 10/14 days. Ugh. lol 

I am waiting for ITS to update the container so that I can do tuning.
