The in-use data for my ANNs is majorly in there, as are some of the preprocessing files. 

Up-to-date testing code is in the ANN-code file.

After a constant battle of trying to push to what was my original PhD_Work Repo and failing due to pickle files, I now have it fixed. 
The most "up to date", if you can call it that, content in here is within the `Full_GPH_PV_Models` folder. The merged model folder contains my code relevant to my AGU 2024 presentation.
